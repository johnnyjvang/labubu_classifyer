# ðŸ§  Labubu Classifier

This is a simple image classification web app that uses a trained PyTorch model (ResNet18) to identify whether an uploaded image is **Labubu** or **Not Labubu**. The app is built using **Flask** and deployed using **Render**.

## ðŸš€ How It Works

1. **Upload an image** using the web interface.
2. The image is processed and passed through a fine-tuned ResNet18 model.
3. The model returns:
   - The predicted class: `Labubu` or `Not Labubu`
   - A confidence score (percentage)
4. The uploaded image and results are displayed on the page.
